Hello world. How are you?
Burning, said world.
Why, I asked.
Arrogance, said world.
Hubris, I asked.
Indeed, said world.

Can I do anything, I asked.
World was silent for some time...
What are you doing, I asked.
The same as you all did to me when I asked for help, said world.
When did you ask, I questioned.

I screamed in the forest fire.
I howled in the storm.
I wept in the hurricane.
I hollered in the glacial ice calve.
I poured out my sorrow in the flood.
I withered in anguish in the drought.
Yet you never stopped to help.

I'm sorry I said.
Thank you, said world. But it's too late.
